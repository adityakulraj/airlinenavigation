# Inspiration
1.No location based networking between airline employees.

2.No data for the employees for crowd management.

3.No use latest technology for user experience.

4.No network for group travellers to co-ordinate their movements.

 # What it does
Uses Bluetooth beacons to track to users' location.

Helps in building a location based network of employees.Employees can track each others location

3.Helps group travellers on the airport to build a private network and pin-point each others' location for efficient communication.

4.Uses Augmented Reality for in-airport navigation from one spot to another

5.Objects of interest are augmented to enrich the user experience.

6.Helps in crowd management for the airline as both the locations of employees and user are known.

# How we built it
1.Android Studio for the mobile app.

2 .Vuforia SDK for Augmented Reality experience.

3.We used Node.js for the Crowd Management Web Page.

# Bussiness Model : The Setup

1.Approx. 200-250 beacons can map the whole terminal

2.Estimated Initial Set-up cost of $3000.

3.The initial set-up cost will be borne by the airlines.

# What's next for Augmented Aviation
1.As the number of users of the app grow new beacons can be installed by the airport kiosks.

2.Help in building an AR navigation Network through the airport shops.

3.The airport can earn revenue as the shops can push offers to the AR app.
